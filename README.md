I am a quick learner, able to dive into pretty much anything, and able to learn new things almost instantly. 
I enjoy programming and ever since the beginning of Covid-19 I have come to realize that programming is one of the biggest things that makes me tick, 
it has given me hope that if I hadn't found it, I would of been dead. 
I love diving in and learning new languages. I am very teachable and love to listen. 
I am a very friendly and caring person, I LOVE helping others see their project/goals acomplished. 
I am a transgender woman living in the Florida panhandle with my amazing wife who is my best friend and my biggest support, I wouldn't be here if I hadn't met her.
